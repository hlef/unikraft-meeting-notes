## :dart: Agenda

Today Michalis and Razvan are not here; let's just do a simple status update.

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

There is very little attendance (only Serban), so we went for a very quick round.

Serban: working on the ASLR implementation, was hoping to finish but wasn't able to.
Serban: finished the implementation for the release 11, fortunately was able to fix issues
Serban: unfortunately I cannot rebase to release 12 - setup.c (kvm x86) + linker.uk (multiboot)
Serban: the main problem is with ukboot_info struct; some fields are no longer in the struct

Hugo: on my side very little progress on whatever I had to do - will update next time

UPDATE: then Carol came and we had a quick chat

Carol: I started with Coverity scan, saw that someone tried to scan the Unikraft code-base
Carol: unfortunately since you can only scan one repository you cannot get the full overview
Carol: I'm trying to put everything in a single repository - is it a good idea?

Hugo: it's likely to be very dependant on how the static analyzer works - it's worth trying

Carol: I've tried other analyzers and it seems that Polyspace is the most suited because
Carol: it handles pointer arithmetic really nicely, but it's sooo slow - in the order of days
Carol: Coverity has a nice incremental feature that allows it to avoid repeating scans when
Carol: not necessary and Polyspace doesn't have it
Carol: Plus Polyspace is closed source

Carol: But Coverity is more shallow

Hugo: Maybe a hybrid approach that uses Coverity for everyday sorts of scan, but use Polyspace
Hugo: on a per-release basis

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

Serban: I will contact Marc who did many of these r12 breaking changes to clarify things
